# FakeStore-SwiftUI

FakeStore-SwiftUI is an iOS e-commerce application built entirely with SwiftUI.

The project leverages the `FakeStoreCore` Swift package to handle the business logic, domain models, repositories, and data persistence layer. This allows the UI layer to remain focused strictly on presentation and user interactions, following clean architecture principles.

By decoupling the business logic into the reusable `FakeStoreCore` module, the project ensures better modularization, testability, and scalability. This package is also shared with the UIKit version of the app.

> This SwiftUI implementation is still under active development and will continue to evolve as new features are added.
